0.1.4
======
- Fix typo with logging 'offlineATM' configuration to serial
- Remove unused WebServer to reduce build time, file size and installation time
- Show a little "arrow" in front of the selected menu item to avoid ambiguity when only 2 menu items are present (or when the user is color blind)
- Make "USB" indicator blue so it looks better and is easier to distinguish
- Show firmware version at boot to allow the user to easily check which version is running (handy for troubleshooting)
